/*students streaks analysis with SQL*/

-- 1-What
/*Streak is a metric used usually by EdTech businesses and learning platforms , 
it is the number of consecutive interactions counted by days*/

-- 2-Whay
/*streak is useful to know how often people engage with the product.*/


-- The statement of business task:
/*Identifying your most engaged students 
so they can give you insights into how and why they engage with the product.*/



-- Prepare the Data :
 /*In this Student Steaks Analysis with SQL project, 
 Iâ€™ll work with real-world data in SQL and a provided learning streak table from 365 Data Science website.
 'https://learn.365datascience.com/projects/student-streaks-analysis-with-sql/'*/
 
 
 
 -- Processing the Data :
 
SELECT 
    *

    streaks.user_streaks_sql
LIMIT 10;

-- Analyzing the Data :
 
  -- 1- Calculating Longest Streak
       
	-- Initialize the variables
SET @streak_count = 0;
SET @prev_user_id = NULL;
SET @prev_streak_active = NULL;

Answer: 66*/

/*Question 2: Which following user_id is NOT a part of the top learners list of user streaks?
Answer: 123894*/

/*Question 3: How many subscribers have accomplished the maximum streak of 31 active days on the platform?
Answer: 5*/

-- In conclusion:

-- *There are 66 users with streaks of 30 days or longer.
-- *The user with the ID 123894 is not part of the top learners list of user streaks.
-- *5 subscribers have accomplished the maximum streak of 31 active days on the platform.

/*Please note that these conclusions are based on the information provided 
and the analysis performed using the SQL queries. If you have any further questions or
